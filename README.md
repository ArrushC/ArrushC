<h3>Hi, I’m Arrush 👋</h3>

I’m a software engineer who likes making systems *fast*, *reliable*, and *pleasant to work with*.  
Based in the UK (Reading/London).

### You’ll find here
Mostly practical stuff: small utilities, experiments, and notes from trying to make software faster and simpler.  
*No streaks, no badges; just code I’d want to keep.*

### Now
Working on low latency systems and a few agentic AI experiments.

Hiring or collaborating? I’m open to interesting problems.
