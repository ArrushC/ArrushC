# Hi there! I'm Arrush üë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome to my profile where you will find information about me (a lot of repositories are private but will make them public soon). I'm a student at the University of Bath studying MComp (Hons.) Computer Science.

<!--
I'm a Computer Science student that has endless passion and enthusiasm ever since I was introduced to the subject. This has motivated me to do everything I can possibly do to gain an in-depth knowledge about it. I have finished GCE Advanced Level qualifications (known as A-Levels) in May 2021 for Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics.
