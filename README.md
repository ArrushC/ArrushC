<h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Arrush ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Iâ€™m a software engineer who likes making systems *fast*, *reliable*, and *pleasant to work with*.  
Based in the UK (Reading/London). *Actively interviewing* while employed.

### What Iâ€™m into
<ul>
  <li>Distributed systems that behave under load and fail calmly.</li>
  <li>Low latency work done the boring way: measure, profile, cache, batch.</li>
  <li>AI in production when it helps users: retrieval that works, honest evals, guardrails.</li>
  <li>Fin/quant pipelines where determinism, reproducibility, and tight budgets matter.</li>
</ul>

### Youâ€™ll find here
Mostly practical stuff: small utilities, experiments, and notes from trying to make software faster and simpler.  
*No streaks, no badges; just code Iâ€™d want to keep.*

### Now
Working on low latency services, better release tooling, and a few agentic AI experiments.

Hiring or collaborating? Iâ€™m open to interesting problems.
